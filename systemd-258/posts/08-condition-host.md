8️⃣ Here's the 8th post highlighting key new features of the upcoming v258 release of systemd.
[#systemd258](https://mastodon.social/tags/systemd258)

Since a long time systemd has had the `ConditionHost=` unit file setting,
which allows limiting execution of a unit to a specific host.
As argument it takes either a hostname (with shell-style globbing,
nicely aligning with the question mark logic in `/etc/hostname`,
as in the 5th episode of this season of this series),
or a machine ID (i.e. `/etc/machine-id`) specification.

This is useful as you can ship a single configuration for a fleet of devices,
but still have some of it be specific to a subset (or exclude a subset) of the whole fleet.
(In fact, by combining the question mark stuff with the glob matching you can even execute services on a randomized subset of your fleet this way…)

With v258 we are slightly extending `ConditionHost=` a bit.
In addition to matching against the two aforementioned host identifiers,
the setting may now also match against the boot ID
(i.e `/proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id`)
and the product ID of the hardware
(i.e. `run0 varlinkctl call /run/systemd/io.systemd.Hostname io.systemd.Hostname.Describe '' | jq -r .ProductUUID`).

The former is useful as it means you can deploy configuration that will only apply to a certain
*state* of the system, while the latter might be useful if your inventory tracks hardware instead of OS installations.
