1️⃣9️⃣ Here's the 19th  post highlighting key new features of the upcoming v258 release of systemd. [#systemd258](https://mastodon.social/tags/systemd258)

Service units for systemd can optionally register a PAM session, and run its processes inside. This is used for a number of uses, including "run0" (so that the target shell runs within a proper PAM session with all PAM modules in effect), and user@*.service (the system service that contains the per-user service manager).

Except of course, that that's not quite true anymore: systemd-homed manages per-user encrypted file systems that are unlocked at login time. This is systematically different from the weak security model of traditional UNIX home directories where encryption does not take place per-user, and the data of the user is protected by system-wide encryption at best (which is unlocked at boot time and that's it), and thus privileged code (incl. the admin) has free access to the user's data anytime.

To be able to access a user's home directory (when managed with systemd-homed) it is thus strictly necessary to acquire the decryption key for it, and that must come from somewhere – typically a PAM question for the user's password.

Thus, when using run0 or user@.service on some user that hasn't already been unlocked strictly requires interactive answers to password prompts, except that as mentioned before we'd deny those. Or in other words, so far, using user@.service in lingering mode…

… or accessing a user account via run0 (if the account uses systemd-homed and wasn't logged in already) would always fail. 

In v258 we are doing something about it: if a PAM session ends up requesting the user to answer a question this will no longer just be refused, but instead be forwarded to the usual "ask-password" subsystem of systemd, that is also used to handle LUKS FDE passwords prompts, and which can ask for passwords via Plymouth (i.e. via the boot-time splash) or locally in a TTY.

The effect of this is really nice, it means you can now use systemd-homed home directories even in lingering mode – however, if you do you'll be prompted for the user's password at boot as part of the boot process. Moreover you can now nicely log into a systemd-homed account via "run0 -u …", and simply provide the unlock password from there.

It basically allows you to run per-user services headless already at boot and until shutdown, independently of having an interactive login session.

[@Werhaus](https://chaos.social/@Werhaus) yeah, it's generic, if a PAM module asks a question via pam_conv stuff, it will be processed via the askpw logic

## Q&A

> **[@pid_eins](https://mastodon.social/@pid_eins/114710117956925791):** This logic has been in place for a longer time, but there was a major limitation: PAM modules are supposed to be able to query the user for questions, such as passwords and similar. So far, any such requests issued by the PAM session modules for such services were refused immediately, thus typically causing any relevant PAM modules to fail.

This has worked great for a long time, since thankfully PAM session modules even though they can – typically don't prompt for anything.

Except of course, that that's not quite true anymore: systemd-homed manages per-user encrypted file systems that are unlocked at login time. This is systematically different from the weak security model of traditional UNIX home directories where encryption does not take place per-user, and the data of the user is protected by system-wide encryption at best (which is unlocked at boot time and that's it), and thus privileged code (incl. the admin) has free access to the user's data anytime.

> **[@JigenDaisukeJr](https://mastodon.social/@JigenDaisukeJr/114710179560962745):** [@pid_eins](https://mastodon.social/@pid_eins) I said it before and I'll say it again - homed is one of the best ways to manage user's home in modern systems. And what is the "lingering mode", btw ?
