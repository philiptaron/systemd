1️⃣0️⃣ Here's the 10th post highlighting key new features of the upcoming v259 release of systemd. [#systemd259](https://mastodon.social/tags/systemd259) [#systemd](https://mastodon.social/tags/systemd)

This one is quick, and basically just a continuation of the previous episode: in order to show the current state of the NvPCRs, you may now use `systemd-analyze nvpcrs`.
This closely mirrors the existing `systemd-analyze pcrs` that shows you the current state of all regular PCRs.
